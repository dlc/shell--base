# Example Shell::Base rcfile
# The file format for these config files is pretty standard:
#
#   o '#' begins a oconfig line
#
#   o whitespace is (mostly) ignored
#
#   o All variable definitions are in the form 'name' = 'value'

# Whitespace within assignments is OK
name =     John Smith
phone=6175551212

# Leading whitespace is OK
        date_format  = %Y/%m/%d

# This works too
lemon => meringue

# later assignments of items clobber the first (there are no
# array types)
foo = bar

# foo is turned into 1
foo

# negated boolean (variable is 'bar')
nobar

# Embedded spaces and such
spacetest = hello,  world  and  all  that

# line continuation
baz = \
  quux

# Multi-line continuation
quote = \
Holy \
shit \
w00t!


# quoted variables retain their quotes
quoted = "Hello, world"
